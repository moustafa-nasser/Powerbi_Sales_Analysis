## 🔍 Business Problem
Companies often struggle to monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in real-time and understand customer behavior effectively. This dashboard aims to solve these challenges by answering critical business questions:
1. What are the total sales and profits across different time periods?
2. Which products contribute the most to revenue (Top Selling Products)?
3. How does sales performance vary across different regions?
4. What are the Year-over-Year (YoY) and Month-over-Month (MoM) growth trends?
